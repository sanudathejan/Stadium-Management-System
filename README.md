# Stadium Seat Booking and Management System

A Stadium Seat Booking and Management System is a Java-based project designed to let users reserve seats for events, track seat availability, and manage stadium operations efficiently. This system is ideal for a group of CS undergraduates and highlights skills in Java, GUI development, SQL database management, and system design.

---------------------------Core Features----------------------------------------

User Registration & Login: Both users and administrators can register and securely log in to the system.

Event & Seat Management: Users can view scheduled events, available seat categories (like Normal, End Stands, Ringside), and select specific seats for booking.

Booking Process:
*Real-time seat availability and visual seat selection.
*Random or user-selected seat assignment.
*Confirmation dialogs and booking summaries.
*Option to preorder food or add services during seat booking.

Database Integration: Stores user data, booking records, seat status, and event details using SQL (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).

Admin Panel:
*Manage event schedules, stadium information, seat maps, booking history, and food/services.
*Update seat availability and pricing instantly.
*Reporting: View booking statistics, previous bookings, and generate reports for management.
*Notifications & Feedback: Notify users about booking status and event changes.

Recommended Java Technologies & Frameworks
Java Swing/JavaFX: For interactive desktop GUIs.

Spring Boot: For building web-based backends, creating REST APIs, and scalable logic.

Hibernate/JPA: For object-relational mapping and streamlined database connections.

MySQL/PostgreSQL: For back-end data storage and queries.

Possible Extensions
*Integration of payment processing for online ticket purchase.
*QR code generation for e-tickets.
*Mobile app or responsive web frontend.
*Real-time crowd and facility management dashboards.

This project stands out as both practical and innovative, going beyond common management systems by integrating seat selection logic, multi-event scheduling, and optional value-added services.
